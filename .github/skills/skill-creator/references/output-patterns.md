# Output Patterns

Use output patterns when a skill must produce consistent, high-quality outputs.

## Template Pattern

Provide templates for strict outputs (API responses, reports) and examples for flexible outputs.

Example (strict template):

```markdown
## Report structure

# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary
[One-paragraph overview]

## Key findings
- Finding 1
- Finding 2

## Recommendations
1. Actionable item 1
2. Actionable item 2
```

## Examples

Give input/output pairs to show the desired style and level of detail.
